Built around an electric ducted fan, the platform is instrumented to characterize thrust, RPM, efficiency, and flight performance through both static ground runs and flight testing. Just as importantly, it is the foundation of our avionics, sensing, and RC flight operations. Every system and process we prove here carries forward to the faster, more complex airframes that come next.",
